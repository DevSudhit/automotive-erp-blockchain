- Smart contracts for automated processes
- Real-time tracking of automotive parts
- Enhanced transparency across stakeholders

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevSudhit/automotive-erp-blockchain.git
   cd automotive-erp-blockchain

2. **Install dependencies for the backend:**
    cd backend
    npm install

3. **Start MongoDB:**
    mongod

4. **Start the server:**
    npm start


## Usage
If you want to use the smart contract functionality, switch to the `blockchain_main` branch and follow these additional steps:

1. **Switch to the blockchain branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout blockchain_main
2. **Set up your Ethereum environment** (like Ganache or a test network) and ensure itâ€™s running.

3. **Deploy your smart contract** using a tool like Truffle or Hardhat, and update the contractAddress in your server.js file accordingly.

4. **Ensure your Web3.js** configuration points to the correct Ethereum node.

5. **Add items or shipments via the API** and verify that transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
